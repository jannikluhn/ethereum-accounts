# Ethereum Accounts

This is a Python library for working with Ethereum accounts. Its main features are keystore import
and export, as well as message and transaction signing. Seamless integration with
[web3.py](https://github.com/pipermerriam/web3.py) using its middleware API allows sending
transactions even if the RPC node does not manage the user's private keys.

## Installation

```Python
pip install ethereum-accounts
```
